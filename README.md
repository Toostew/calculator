<h1>Basic calculator with GUI using javaFX</h1>
this is a basic calculator that supports arithmetic operations, follows precedence rules under BODMAS.
this project applies the Shunting-yard algorithm to convert arithmetic expressions received from the gui into Reverse-Polish-notation,
which is evaluated to follow BODMAS rules

this project is meant to familiarize myself with the maven workflow, Java Platform Module System (JPMS) as well as get myself used to reading api documentation (javaFX) written in 1875
there are a few touch ups that I have yet to impliment and can be seen pointed out with TODO
